1. Backend Framework: FastAPI

Decision: Use FastAPI (Python) for the backend.

Reasoning:

Lightweight and fast for building APIs.

Supports async requests, useful for AI calls and database queries.

Easy integration with Pydantic for input validation.

Well-suited for a solo developer with Python knowledge.

2. Frontend: Minimal HTML + JavaScript

Decision: Single-page web interface with dropdowns, input box, and output area.

Reasoning:

Focused on functionality over aesthetics.

Easy to connect to the FastAPI backend.

No need for complex frameworks (React, Vue, etc.) for a prototype.

3. AI Architecture: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Decision: Combine vector-based retrieval of concept chunks with an LLM for explanation.

Reasoning:

Ensures explanations are curriculum-aligned.

AI never decides correctness; rules handle grading.

Retrieval ensures the AI explains using actual syllabus concepts.

Provides flexibility to scale for multiple grades or chapters later.

4. Vector Database: Supabase

Decision: Store concept embeddings in Supabase.

Reasoning:

Easy to set up and manage for a student project.

Supports vector operations for fast similarity search.

Lightweight, hosted, and free-tier friendly.

Compatible with Python backend.

5. AI/LLM Choice

Decision: Use Hugging Face hosted models (free-tier) instead of OpenAI API.

Reasoning:

Avoids costs for a student developer.

Models are small enough to run hosted, avoiding local resource limitations.

Allows experimentation with embeddings + explanation pipeline without requiring high-spec hardware.

6. Curriculum Representation

Decision: Encode chapters into concept chunks (definition, reasoning, misconceptions, example patterns).

Reasoning:

Aligns explanations to Telangana State Board syllabus.

Facilitates RAG retrieval for AI explanation.

Allows expansion or revision without changing core backend.

7. Correctness Verification: Rule-Based

Decision: Deterministic rules to validate correctness before calling AI.

Reasoning:

AI should never mark answers as correct or incorrect.

Avoids reliance on potentially unreliable LLM outputs.

Ensures grading is predictable and safe.

8. File & Folder Structure

Decision:

/backend — API and logic

/curriculum — JSON files for chapters

/examples — Sample requests and responses

Reasoning:

Clear separation of concerns

Easy for reviewers or future developers to navigate

Supports reproducibility of experiments

9. Logging & Error Handling

Decision: Use Python logging in the backend; basic HTTPException handling.

Reasoning:

Provides visibility into pipeline steps (validation, retrieval, explanation)

Helps debug errors without exposing sensitive information

10. Scope Limitation

Decision: Stop development after building functional prototype.

Reasoning:

Board exam preparation required focus

Prototype already demonstrates key concepts, AI pipeline, and design thinking

Prioritized quality of implementation over feature expansion
